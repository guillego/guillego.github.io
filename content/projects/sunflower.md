[a sunflower grows in Ã˜sterbro (external)](https://sunflower.guillego.com/)

I made this small project in the fall of 2024, when I faced the prospect of traveling away from my apartment for nearly a month while my sunflower blossomed. I had been working on a Raspberry Pi-based sports camera during the previous year so it seemed very natural to set up a <abbr title="RPi4 board + RPiCam v3">little camera</abbr> to take a photo every hour as the flower grew and blossomed.

It took an evening to set up and brought me great joy in the following month, read more in the about section of the site.
