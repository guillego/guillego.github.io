Many times in my life I have tried to start a blog, and failed to keep up with it. Often times it was this voice inside that told me that I didn't have anything interesting to say, or that
it was too personal, or that there were too many things I was not doing well in my life, so I didn't need to expose myself more.
My general response to those voices, and to many others is to try to shut them down by avoiding doing whatever it is that triggers them. It's some sort of feeling between fear and shame,
a little monster creature that I didn't want to name.

I recently started reading [Daring greatly, by Bren√© Brown](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/c2ea6d65-b7be-46cc-852b-195205397e31) and it inspired me to start naming
these gremlins. Mainly for my own sake, but perhaps someone out there feels a little more power over their own gremlins now that they've been named here.

In the next few weeks I want to get into the flow of posting here about the things that I find inspiring/interesting or just as a public log of a day/activity.

Feel free to come along for the ride, and let me know if you find anything interesting/inspiring or if you want to chat!
