For a few years now, I've enjoyed cycling as a hobby and bikepacking as a favorite way of traveling.
This year brought a big break from work where both Carole and I were free. She had never done a bike trip before,
but curious to explore the lifestyle for herself, she suggested that we travel from Switzerland to Spain and thus the trip was born.

### The itinerary

Ideally we would travel from Carole's hometown to mine, but time constraints due to other commitments left us with 22 days.
Therefore we decided to cover the distance between Gurmels (close to Bern) and San Sebastián, and since we wanted this to be a holiday, we planned some train time to skip over some parts of the route so that we would have time to enjoy, rest and explore nature instead of just following the most optimal path.

Our route ended up like this:

### Food

Most of the time we cooked: oats for breakfast, bread with spreads&cheese for lunch and some camping meal for dinner.
We also snacked on plenty of croissants and other goodies we found in Boulangeries along the way.
Won't list all the food we carried, but it got a bit crazy sometimes:
