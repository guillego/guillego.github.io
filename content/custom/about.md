Hi!

Iâ€™m Guille. You may also know me as guillego or iamsiesta.

I'm a [telecom-turned-biomedical-turned-software engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillermo-go/).

Born and raised in Madrid, Spain, moved to Copenhagen a few years ago, where my favorite things are cycling through the city,
jumping into the sea, eating pastries and the long days of summer.

Professionally, these days I'm working across the stack (Rust/React) in the SaaS world, reducing the friction and manual process of compliance for large companies. I'm particularly attracted to distributed systems and have found a lot of joy when working with Elixir and most recently in Go and Rust. I'm also genuinely curious about the electric grid and how to share/distribute electricity in a less centralized manner.

In the past couple of years I spent some time building a distributed IoT sports camera system and developing a computer vision virtual coach for racket sports at a Copenhagen startup.
Previously spent a few years in the health-tech domain, augmenting radiology at [Radiobotics](https://radiobotics.com).

I like to [capture life with my camera](https://instagram.com/iamsiesta/), take trips on my bike, rock climb and write.

I devour podcasts, books, wikipedia, blogs and any source of interesting information. Is there such thing as being too curious?
