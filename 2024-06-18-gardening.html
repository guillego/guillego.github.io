      gardening
    </h2>
    <em>June 18th, 2024</em>
    <p>
    The sunlight and birdsong fill the streets today, it's far too early for anyone to consciously notice
    how this light is leaking through the windows into the big, green plants that populate my apartment.
    It's a warm summer morning in Copenhagen.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of course I don't notice this until hours later when I wake up and wander into the living room. It's the kind of
    morning when I'm still a bit in awe at all the life and light before me, especially because my yesterday self took
    the time to tidy up before going to sleep.
  </p>

  <p>
    The plants look vibrant and thriving in this season. On one corner lives a lush ficus robusta that has lived in various
    corners of the room and thus has grown a contorted torso in its seeking to bend towards the light.
    On the opposing sides of the room, its two cousins, the ficus lyrata, stand tall and straight.
    The tallest had a hard time this winter before moving homes and lost all its leaves,
    one could be forgiven for thinking that it wouldn't make it past December.
    Not knowing what to do, I left for the holidays and hoped for the best.
    Turns out it only needed space and time to be still,
    and when I came back bright leaves greeted me as they made their way through the bark.
  </p>

  <p>
    My house is populated by many other leafy beings: some monsteras, a philodendron, tradescantia and alocasia zebrinas, and even a blue star fern that moved in last winter.
    However long before many of those, there was the lemon tree. The lemon tree sits by the window with no shade other than the one provided by the Danish clouds.
    Standing just under a meter from the base of its pot, it's not an orchard tree but a companion tree. </br>
    Throughout our four years together, it has grown dozens of leaves, some flowers and one lemon.
    Every winter, the lemon tree disposes of all its leaves, sitting bare by the window, leaving me wondering if it's giving up on this dark environment or merely resting.
    Without fail, every spring brings new growth from its branches, and every summer blooming flowers.
  </p>
  
    <p>
    I don't know a lot about botany, but I know enough to know that I love this lemon tree,
    that I like to observe how it behaves and learn from how it adapts, from how it waits patiently for the spring, that I find myself just wanting to help it thrive without judging when it doesn't meet my expectations.
    And I don't know much about anthropology, but I know enough to know that I wish this is how humans behaved towards each other and ourselves.
